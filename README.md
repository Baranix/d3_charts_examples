These d3.js code was created by Nikki Ebora.

covid_19_data_bar.html and covid_19_data_bar.html uses the data sets covid19_agegroup.csv and covid19_cases_by_date.csv respectively. The data was acquired from the publicly available dataset provided by the Department of Health, Philippines. This dataset was chosen because I have worked with it before.

In order to load covid_19_data_bar.html and covid_19_data_bar.html, they must be in a server. I used "py -m http.server" for a quick server.

bear.html was for fun. :)
